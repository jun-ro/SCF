# SCF

SCF or Simple Combat Framework, is a set of modules and utilities designed specifically for combat games on the popular gaming platform known as Roblox. Written in Luau. Currently the main framework behind the upcoming game Wildcard.

## Why SCF?

SCF is a no-nonsense Roblox framework designed to make developing combat games as easy as possible whilst still keeping a sense of modularity alongside clean code. SCF won't get in your way when making features or systems, it won't force you to utilize a certain paradigm or complex architecture.

**Write your own code, use SCF when you need it.**
## Installation

Simply head over to releases and install the latest .rbxm file. Open it and drag and drop the module script to your own game.
    
## Features

- **Attack Module** - Used for making attack logic super simple
- **StateManagement Module** - Used for defining states and their init functions. Super Simple.
- **Relay Module** - Used for allowing server side functions be declared within a single module script, no need for manual remote events.
- **Animation Module** - Used for dynamic loading of animations that come preloaded.
- **Networking Module** - Used for easily defining server/client events in modules, again, without any manual work.
- **ServerManagement Module** - Used for defining and executing server-side functions.
- **Util Module*** - Contains functions for everyday QOF functions.
